## Motivation

I spent the last few years developing different solutions based on ESP devices. It all started with ESP8266, where CPU power is not really sufficient to do real-time decoding, so you're limited to a rather simple ding-dong business. Then ESP32 came, bringing two much more capable cores, so you have a powerhouse to handle communication and decoding at the same time. Perhaps most importantly, it also came with SPIRAM, so you can do decent buffering (essential for streamed content). Now, new ESP32 C-Series and S-Series chips are entering the market, and their potential is mostly unrealized as of today.

I created those docks and subsequently development boards to be able to quickly prototype for the whole range of ESP8266 and ESP32 chips, starting with the simplest finger-sized toys and going all the way up to full-sized speakers.

## HiFi-ESP32 

The HiFi-ESP32 is a first-in-line product that uses the legendary PCM5100 series DAC with supreme audio quality. It exposes line-level output that you can plug into a stereo amplifier. Analog power comes through an Ultra-low-noise LDO, making sure no interference from the MCU comes through to your speakers. Spend as much as you need on the external amp to deliver the sound you like (personally, I prefer late 80's audio gear).

## Loud-ESP32

The Loud-ESP32 uses a dual MAX98357 HiFi DAC with a built-in highly efficient D-class amp to deliver 3 to 5W of music power directly to your speakers. It is not too loud, but also very simple to use and fun to play with. When DAC is not in use, it goes into shutdown mode, making sure no hissing will keep you up at night. It powers from a standard USB-C power source, like a phone charger, etc.

## Amped-ESP32

The PCM5100 HiFi DAC is combined with a highly efficient TPA3110D2 D-class amplifier (replaced by TPA3128 starting Rev H). It brings all the best from the HiFi model and adds an onboard amp to form a complete solution that can be paired with speakers directly. It uses an external power source to feed hungry amps and the host MCU using an onboard drop-down converter. It has similar power capabilities to the Louder model, but it is much simpler to use since it only needs a valid I2S signal to operate, so a simple book example code will do it.

## Louder-ESP32

The Louder-ESP32 is a top-of-the-range model that uses a modern, highly capable TAS5805M DAC and is aimed to be paired with medium-to-large speaker systems. With 25W per channel stereo output, it packs a punch and can easily enliven living quarters or dorm rooms. It is highly efficient, but much more demanding for power when cranked; therefore, it also uses an external power adapter using a standard  jack. This DAC has a built-in DSP, so you can have a lot of fun with complex EQ, soft-clipping, DRC compression, and AGL tools, among other things.

### Onboard PSRAM

Audio streaming requires proper buffering to work; even with the ESP32's 500K of RAM, it is a challenging task. For that reason, most of the projects will require WROVER modules that have onboard PSRAM chips.  All ESP32 Audio boards have an 8MB PSRAM chip onboard, connected via a high-speed interface. Any code using PSRAM just works out-of-the box.

### Mic header

Both versions of the Louder-ESP32 boards (ESP32 Rev. H6+, ESP32-S3 Rev. K0+) and HiFi-ESP32 (ESP32 Rev. F3+, ESP32-S3 Rev. G2+) have an unsoldered header for external I2S mic: left and right channels. ESP32 uses the same I2S bus with an extra DATA IN pin due to the pin limitations, while S3 uses a dedicated I2S bus. It can be used for wake word functionality in the Home Assistant or for custom firmware.

|                         | I2S CLK | I2S WS | I2S DATA |
|-------------------------|---------|--------|----------|
| ESP32                   | 26      | 25     | 13       |
| ESP32-S3                | 41      | 40     | 39       |
| HIFI-ESP32-S3 (Rev G2+) | 17      | 18     | 8        |

The mic model that I used for testing and validation is the INMP441 MEMS microphone; the pinout is created for this model. Other models might be available.

<img width="1062" height="852" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77612aca-5ca4-4052-b1b4-3467b012ad30" />

## Software samples

In the [software](/firmware) section, two firmware examples are provided.

- [esp32-i2s-bare](/firmware/esp32-i2s-bare/) is base I2S implementation based on ESP-IDF implementation directly.
- [esp32-i2s-esp8266audio](/firmware/esp32-i2s-esp8266audio/) is based on excellent [ESP8266Audio](https://github.com/earlephilhower/ESP8266Audio) library (it works with the whole ESP range, don't get fooled by the name), providing minimum code implementation. 
- [esp32-i2s-web-radio](/firmware/esp32-i2s-web-radio/) is based on the [same library](https://github.com/earlephilhower/ESP8266Audio), providing minimum web-readio stream player. It expects a playlist as input in the 'data' folder.
- [Squeezelite-ESP32](https://github.com/sle118/squeezelite-esp32) - see more details [below](#Squeezelite-ESP32)

### Platformio IDE
 
All samples are provided as [Plarformio IDE](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) projects. After installing it, open the sample project. Select the proper environment based on your dock. Run the `Build` and `Upload` commands to install necessary tools and libraries, and build and upload the project to the board. Communication and proper upload method selection will be handled by IDE automatically. 

### Arduino IDE

Follow the [ESP8266Audio](https://github.com/earlephilhower/ESP8266Audio) library guide. Default settings will work out of the box with ESP8266 and ESP32 boards. For the ESP32C3 and ESP32S2 board, please adjust the pinout according to the above section

## Using ESP32 Audio Boards with the Home Assistant

There are several ways ESP32 Audio Boards can be integrated into the Home Assistant setup. Each of them gives a unique feature, losing some other in return. As usual, there is no perfect solution for everyone, but perhaps there is one for you. Below is the summary table of the methods known to me and tested by me.

| Integration type                                                                                                          | Tested  | Description                                                                                                                      | Pros                                                                                                                   | Cons                                                                                                    |

Below are specific steps that you need to follow to spin up ESP32 Audio Boards in the Home Assistant

### Configuring Home Assistant

I prefer to use HA with the Music Assistant. This way, you can integrate both your media library and internet radio and have a nice UI/UX at the same time (including mobile).

Generally, you need to have a supported HA (native) installation and follow [these steps](https://music-assistant.io/integration/installation/). I will place here a short version to have a reminder for future self

### Home Assistant: LMS or Airplay

[gh://sle118/squeezelite-esp32](https://github.com/sle118/squeezelite-esp32)

When you have squeezelite-esp32 installed on your ESP32 Audio Board (either stock or manually going through [steps](#squeezelite-esp32)), it will announce itself by multiple protocols in the network:

- Bluetooth
- LMS or slimproto - auto-discovered by HA
- Apple AirPlay - auto-discovered by HA
- Spotify Connect

The power of this method is that you can use all four ways outside of HA, for example, using your smartphone and Spotify app, and still have it integrated into HA at the same time.

<details>
  <summary>Install instructions</summary>
  
#### Native HA integration

Make sure your MA Slimproto provider is disabled; it will conflict with the native HA integration 

| Step | Screenshot |
|------|------------|
| **Add SlimProto Integration** <br/> <br/> Navigate to HA Settings > Devices & services > Integrations. Click the big + ADD INTEGRATION button, look for  SlimProto, and install it. | ![image](https://github.com/sonocotta/esparagus-media-center/assets/5459747/67c0efec-6774-404b-b63d-e13151025147)

#### Integrate into Music Assistant directly 

Disable SlimProto integration in the HA if you want to go the MA way. If you enabled SlimProto and AirPlay providers in the MA, you should find your device as both a Slimproto device and an AirPlay device. It is up to you which protocol to use; generally, they both work perfectly well.

### Home Assistant: ESPHome way

[Louder-ESP32 running ESPHome](https://www.espthings.io/index.php/2024/04/07/louder-esp32-a-hi-fi-class-d-audio-amplifier-running-esphome/)

Please find specific ESPHome configs in the [firmware](/firmware/esphome/) folder. It should be noted that generally esp-idf-based configurations are preferred over the Arduino counterparts, since they are lighter, faster, and more stable, which is important for audio streaming. However, many components do not work with esp-idf; thus, Arduino examples are also provided. Due to the complexity of the TAS5805M driver, it only exists in the esp-idf variant.

The latest changes in the ESPHome (deprecation of the custom components) triggered a work to implement an external [TAS5805M DAC ESPHome component](https://github.com/mrtoy-me/esphome-tas5805m). It took some time, but this driver implements a few very important features of the TAS5805M DAC that can not only be used in the device configuration, but also in various automations and complex logic. Worth noting:

- Possibility to configure Analog Gain (depending on the power supply you have, more details [here](https://github.com/sonocotta/esp32-tas5805m-dac/#digital-volume-and-analog-gain)) | 
- Advanced digital volume configuration (set minimum, maximum, and step value)
- <img width="252" height="324" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea81f985-ef8d-48c7-8a52-b3d22d1eea2b" />
- Automatic powersave modes based on playback state
- DAC mode: 2 channel, or 1 channel bridged mode (more details [here](https://github.com/sonocotta/esp32-tas5805m-dac/#setting-and-getting-dac-mode))
- Mixer mode: MONO, STEREO, INVERTED, LEFT, RIGHT (more details [here](https://github.com/sonocotta/esp32-tas5805m-dac/#mixer-controls))
- My favorite: 15 band equalizer with [-15 dB .. +15 dB] range, which is an absolute treat to configure your speakers to your audio taste
- <img width="252" height="619" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9400f057-3e42-441e-aa96-14f551bb9c3e" />
- For the first time: read and reset fault states, no need to reboot the device. Not only reports them back to HA, but also example of automatic correction is provided (slowly reduce volume on overheat)
- <img width="252" height="515" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6863d353-dac2-40b3-8782-4747f04e729d" />

We have some plans for further development of the ESPHome driver, implementing subwoofer and satellite profiles (for 2.1 and bi-amp configs), enabling soft-clipping, and perhaps even unleashing the power of all BQ-parameters (to enable speaker-specific compensation of the DAC). Stay tuned!

### Home Assistant: Snapcast

Snapcast is a multi-room audio player that synchronizes playback across multiple devices, ensuring that audio streams play simultaneously in perfect sync. It consists of a server, which distributes audio streams, and clients, which receive and play the audio. There is a [snapcast](https://github.com/sonocotta/esparagus-snapclient) fork that was created to implement ESP32 Audio Board-specific configuration on top of the ESP32 Snapcast client. This allows us to build flexible and extendable setups connected to various sources, like Mopidy, MPD, or Home Assistant.

</details>

As of mid-2025 work is ongoing ([1](https://github.com/c-MM/esphome-snapclient/), [2](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/8350)) to add snapcast component to ESPHome. This is based on the [original implementation](https://github.com/CarlosDerSeher/snapclient) done by CarlosDerSeher. This has the benefit of enabling all the DAC features implemented by the ESPHome driver. At the moment of writing, there are quite a few issues to be solved in the code before it can be merged, but having tested this myself on a few S3-based boards as long as Louder-Esparagus and Louder-ESP32 boards, I can say it is stable and works really well. Also
- This is the only implementation that works with ESP32-S3 (exciting!)
- This implementation allows using advanced TAS5805M DAC features available in the Esphome driver, like bridge mode and 15-band EQ. If you have Home Assistant already, that's no brainer

## Squeezelite-ESP32

Squeezelite-ESP32 is a multimedia software suite that started as a renderer (or player) of LMS (Logitech Media Server). Now it is extended with 
- **Spotify** over-the-air player using SpotifyConnect (thanks to cspot)
- **AirPlay** controller (iPhone, iTunes ...) and enjoy synchronization multiroom as well (although it's AirPlay 1 only)
- Traditional **Bluetooth** device (iPhone, Android)

And LMS itself
- Streams your local music and connects to all major online music providers (Spotify, Deezer, Tidal, Qobuz) using Logitech Media Server - a.k.a LMS with **multi-room** audio synchronization.
- LMS can be extended by numerous plugins and can be controlled using a Web browser or dedicated applications (iPhone, Android).
- It can also send audio to UPnP, Sonos, Chromecast, and AirPlay speakers/devices.

All ESP32-based boards are tested with [Squeezelite-ESP32](https://github.com/sle118/squeezelite-esp32) software, which can be flashed using nothing but a web browser. You can use [Squeezelite-ESP32 installer](https://sonocotta.github.io/esp32-audio-dock/) for that purpose.

### How to flash and configure

Use [Installer for ESP Audio Dock](https://sonocotta.github.io/esp32-audio-dock/) to flash firmware first. It has been preconfigured to work with ESP Audio boards and will configure all hardware automatically.

### Squeezelite-esp32 reboots and connection drops

The default configuration of the squeezelite-esp32 runs automatic discovery of the available LMS server nearby. In fact, it depends on it so much that in case the LMS service is not found on the network, it will reboot automatically (every few minutes). 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b91f9ef-054e-42a1-81ab-693315fb3b88)

In many cases, if you use squeezelite for AirPlay and Spotify only and don't have an LMS server, you need to disable discovery altogether. Currently, disabling Squeezelite in the GUI does not work correctly; it places too many spaces between the commands in the autoexec command. Following `autoexec1` NVS setting can be used to disable it:

```
squeezelite -o i2s -s -disable -b 500:2000 -C 30 -d all=sdebug
```

## Other smart home options

In case you use Domoticz or OpenHAB, or in fact any other system that supports MQTT integration, [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) is a way to go with ESP32 Audio Devices, which can be integrated into TTS, Media Player, or Web-radio scenarios. Since HiFi-ESP32 and Loud-ESP32 devices only need an I2S signal to work, setting them up would not differ from any other I2S-based device. With Louder-ESP32, it is a little more involved story, but in fact, folks at the Tasmota community did a heavy lifting of porting the I2C driver, and since mid-2025, it is a simple template that can be applied in a few clicks.

Unfortunately, the default configuration of the tasmota firmware would not include I2S by default; building firmware from source is required (which makes it more fun, if you ask me). Below is an instruction that I did test with the Louder-ESP32-S3 board (Non-S3 model will require only minor adjustments along the way)

### Building Tasmota with I2S support

| # | Description  | Image
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pull the source code from the official repo. It is a [Platformio](https://platformio.org/) project, so if you didn't have it before, [install](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) it now <br/> `git clone https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/` | 
| 2 | In the code repository find a file named `user_config_override.h`, and add `USE_I2S_ALL` macro right before closing `#endif` | <img width="833" height="641" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af259c97-151f-4233-892a-91ce4796a51c" />
| 3 | Build and flash using the conifguration named `tasmota32s3` for the S3 model, or `tasmota32` for classic ESP32 | <img width="896" height="638" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7eec814-7f1f-4bcd-b751-ae37d487594e" />
| 4 | Your device will need to connect to a Wi-Fi network, and you do this as usual by connecting to a Wi-Fi hotspot and providing wifi credentials | 

### Connect to the MQTT broker

This step will depend on your specific setup, but since I have Home Assistant, I'll document the steps I had to do in the HA installation I have. Other brokers will fundamentally need the same steps, but clearly every system would have its own specific steps to take.

| # | Description  | Image
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Install the MQTT broker into HA by installing the MQTT Addon. As soon as it is installed, it will use the HA user database, so credentials will be configured elsewhere | <img width="1153" height="572" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/468ade87-d9d4-45fb-9aa5-fff0d1e7ab18" />
| 2 | Add `mqtt_user` in the HA User list. Keep the password nearby, as we will need it to connect the ESP32 device to the broker | <img width="1103" height="570" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04e41f62-3177-4d78-83c4-796bee8dbe7c" />
| 3 | Add MQTT integration to the HA. It will autodiscover the local MQTT broker and connect automatically | <img width="1130" height="568" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c9bbe95-87b1-4e91-bf82-fa11e9288a6e" />
| 4 | Add Tasmota integration to the HA. At this point, it will only connect to MQTT, but it will not find any devices just yet | <img width="1146" height="570" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a580d9bd-e252-4a1e-aa3c-e4fd9ffe9162" />

### Connect Louder-ESP32 to the MQTT broker

| # | Description  | Image
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Find out your device IP address (either from Serial logs or from your WiFi router), since we would need to access its web-UI to configure the device | <img width="983" height="247" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db9e834d-98d3-4ad0-936e-4295b8d2b653" />
| 2 | Navigate to Configure > MQTT section and update your MQTT host, user, and password settings | <img width="944" height="648" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5fda7dd-7106-4edb-9fc1-5c62c0024701" />
| 3 | After the device restarts, it should be able to connect to the broker. This can be confirmed in the Tasmota integration, as it will discover a new device now. | <img width="1135" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6864ec6-af29-445a-b327-2ca752d904a9" />
| 4 | Navigate to Configure > Auto-conf section and apply `Louder-ESP32S3` config. After the device restarts, you're all set. | <img width="1029" height="630" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd241d26-5c22-4a3a-9291-35916d8f2b43" />

### Testing audio playback with MQTT controls

| Description  | Image
|---|---|
| Using the commands described [here](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/I2S-Audio/#internal-dac) you can control device playback | <img width="1104" height="603" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2320f99-421b-4deb-8ff0-4c58ec196106" />
| Start web-radio plaback <br /> topic: `cmnd/tasmota_XXXXXX/i2swr`, payload: `http://192.168.1.48:18000/bb` | <img width="1024" height="341" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc289526-67ed-4982-9882-d2d6f254203c" />
| Stop playback <br/> topic: `cmnd/tasmota_XXXXXX/i2swr`, payload: `` | <img width="1030" height="340" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae931d9f-715c-422e-aa49-dec72ef45675" />
| Change volume <br/> topic: `cmnd/tasmota_XXXXXX/i2sgain`, payload: `85` | <img width="1021" height="338" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2ecc8ca-dade-4b19-a29d-2e0bbd7ac0b0" />
| Commands `I2SRtttl` and `I2Ssay` didn't work for me, unfortunately. I didn't have time yet to figure out what the issue is.

## Flashing ESP32-S3

ESP32-S3 boards have two ways of firmware update: (1) similarly to classic ESP32, they can be flashed over built-in UART, or (2) uniquely for S3, over built-in USB host controller. Since it is firmware-controlled, it may be disabled if not used (or, more commonly, not available with factory default empty firmware). When an unflashed ESP32-S3 device comes into a boot loop, with a USB-CDC device appearing and disappearing every second, and **requires a special flashing initialisation sequence to get flashed**:

- Press the IO0 (FLASH) button and keep it pressed
- Press the RESET button and release the FLASH button after
- ESP32-S3 will enter download mode, and the USB-CDC device will appear and stay available
- Run flashing routine as usual, either through web-serial or `esp_tool`
- This time, it is not possible to reboot the device over USB, so press RESET once more
- Device will boot normally into firmware, and if USB-CDC is enabled in the firmware, you will be able to flash it normally, download mode and reset sequence will work over USB.
- If you manage to flash firmware without USB-CDC support, you need to go through the above sequence once more

### Amped-ESP32 with TPA3128 amp

Originally, I used the TPA3110 amp with Amped Esparagus and Amped-ESP32 boards for its simplicity and availability. The only issue with TAP3110 is that it lacks the MUTE pin. It does have an STBY pin, but as it turned out, it is not pop-free, meaning each time you switch it on and off, the amp makes a loud pop in the speakers. I tried changing the level slowly, but it didn't help.

Help came with a newer TPA3128 amp with revision H of the Amped-ESP32

- It does have a true MUTE pin, and now it is software-controlled on Amped-ESP32. It means that the board starts dead-quiet, and it stays quiet when the audio is paused
- MUTE pin also disables PCM5100 DAC on rev H, so line-out is also dead quiet (not that it was noise before, but why not?)
- It can work with 4.5V, so it plays even when powered from a simple USB-C, similar to Louder-ESP32. TPA3110 needs at least 8V to spin up
- TPA3128 has a marginally better audio quality, as they say. I cannot hear the difference 😉

### Optional SPI Ethernet module

Every board has a header that allows for soldering in a W5500 SPI Ethernet module, which is very easy to find. The only downside is that with the module installed board will not fit the case, unless it is cut to accommodate extra height.

### BTL and PBTL mode (TAS5805M DAC)

[TAS5805M DAC](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tas5805m.pdf?ts=1701767947387) Allows 2 modes of operation - BTL (stereo) and PBTL (parallel, or mono). In Mono, the amp will use a completely different modulation scheme and basically will fully synchronize output drivers. Jumpers on the board allow both output drivers to connect to the same speaker. The most important step is to inform the Amp to change the modulation in the first place via the I2C command. In the case of sqeezelite DAC control set value is the following:
```
dac_controlset: `{"init":[{"reg":3,"val":2},{"reg":3,"val":3},{"reg":2,"val":4}],"poweron":[{"reg":3,"val":3}],"poweroff":[{"reg":3,"val":0}]}`
```
compared to the default:
```
dac_controlset: `{"init":[{"reg":3,"val":2},{"reg":3,"val":3}],"poweron":[{"reg":3,"val":3}],"poweroff":[{"reg":3,"val":0}]}`

```

One can test audio with a single speaker connected between L and R terminals (plus on one side and minus on the other). Optionally, jumpers on the board will effectively connect the second driver in parallel, doubling the current capability.

Important point, this simple setup will send only one channel to the output, that’s just how the basic DAC setup works. In case you want true mono (L + R)/2 or pure R or L audio, you need to apply a mixer configuration. Full config looks like below (thanks @frdfsnlght for helping me [here](https://github.com/sonocotta/esp32-audio-dock/issues/27))

Single speaker (PBTL mode), mono mix (L+R)/2:
```
{"init":[{"reg":3,"val":2},{"reg":3,"val":3},{"reg":2,"val":4},{"reg":0,"val":0},{"reg":127,"val":140},{"reg":0,"val":41},{"reg":24,"val":[0,64,38,231]},{"reg":28,"val":[0,64,38,231]},{"reg":32,"val":[0,0,0,0]},{"reg":36,"val":[0,0,0,0]},{"reg":0,"val":0},{"reg":127,"val":0}],"poweron":[{"reg":3,"val":3}],"poweroff":[{"reg":3,"val":0}]} 
```

Single speaker (PBTL mode), right input only:
```
{"init":[{"reg":3,"val":2},{"reg":3,"val":3},{"reg":2,"val":4},{"reg":0,"val":0},{"reg":127,"val":140},{"reg":0,"val":41},{"reg":24,"val":[0,128,0,0]},{"reg":28,"val":[0,0,0,0]},{"reg":32,"val":[0,0,0,0]},{"reg":36,"val":[0,0,0,0]},{"reg":0,"val":0},{"reg":127,"val":0}],"poweron":[{"reg":3,"val":3}],"poweroff":[{"reg":3,"val":0}]} 
```

Single speaker (PBTL mode), left input only:
```
{"init":[{"reg":3,"val":2},{"reg":3,"val":3},{"reg":2,"val":4},{"reg":0,"val":0},{"reg":127,"val":140},{"reg":0,"val":41},{"reg":24,"val":[0,0,0,0]},{"reg":28,"val":[0,128,0,0]},{"reg":32,"val":[0,0,0,0]},{"reg":36,"val":[0,0,0,0]},{"reg":0,"val":0},{"reg":127,"val":0}],"poweron":[{"reg":3,"val":3}],"poweroff":[{"reg":3,"val":0}]}

### TAS5805M DSP capabilities

The TAS5805M DAC has a very powerful DSP, which allows doing lots of data processing on the silicon, that otherwise would take a considerable part of your CPU time. As of the moment of writing, it is mostly an undiscovered part of the DAC, since, unfortunately, TI is not making it very easy for developers. (A minute of complaint) To be more specific, you need to be (A) a proven hardware manufacturer to get access to the configuration software, namely PurePath. (B) You need to apply for a personal license and go through an approval process, and after a few weeks of waiting, you get access to the DAC configuration you asked for. (C) You find out that it will work with TI's own evaluation board, which will set you back $250 if you'd be able to find one. Otherwise, all you have is a list of I2C commands that you need to transfer to the device at your own cost. No wonder no one knows how to use it.

But moanings aside, what do you get after:

- Flexible input mixer with gain corrections
- 15 EQ with numerous filter configurations
- 3-band Dynamic Range Compression with flexible curve configuration
- Automatic Gain Limiter with flexible configuration
- Soft clipper
- and a few other things

At this moment, it is very experimental. In the perfect world, you should be able to adjust all of those settings to make your speaker-enclosure setup work the best it can, and even apply your room factors into the equation. But with the above disclaimer, I can only deliver a limited set of configurations corresponding to the most common use cases:

- Stereo mode with enabled DRC (Loudness) and AGL settings
- Full range Mono mode with DRC (Loudness) and AGL settings

### Louder-ESP32 and Amped-ESP32 power considerations

[Barrel jack used](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/AC-DC-Power-Connectors_XKB-Connectivity-DC-044D-2-5A-2-0-SMT_C397342.html) is spaced at 6mm hole/2mm pin, which is typically 5.5/2.5mm jack on the male side.

The screw terminal is connected in parallel to the barrel jack; you can use either interchangeably.

On the latest boards (starting from Amped-ESP32), I switched to [barrel jack with thick middle pin](https://atta.szlcsc.com/upload/public/pdf/source/20200812/C720576_7B83670454B7C7E493B4E29DD30CFE1F.pdf) with a **2.5mm pin**, it’s a bit unusual but still common enough in the laptop world. It is far more comfortable in handling high currents, and importantly, much more sturdy and resistant to desoldering.

The power adapter specs depend on the speaker you're planning to use. DAC efficiency is close to 100%, so just take the power rating of your speaker (say 2x10w), and impedance (say 8 ohms), and you'd need  at least `sqrt(10W * 8Ω) ≈ 9V` rated at `9V / 8Ω ≈ 1.2A` per channel, round up to 3 total Amps. 

It is not recommended to go beyond the voltage your speakers can handle; otherwise, the amp will blow your speakers in no time.

I performed Louder-ESP32 board load tests to analyze the thermal stability of the board under maximum load. These tests output a 100Hz sin-wave with a close to rail-to-rail signal (adjusting volume and gain) into an 8-Ohm load (both BD and 1SPW modulation). I started testing with bare naked DAC. As soon as I reached the point where DAC was entering thermal shutdown, I added a small radiator on top, and once more, a larger radiator on the back side (where the thermal pad is connected to the ground plane)

**Conclusion:** Long-term operation without an additional heatsink is only possible up to VCC=15V. Adding a passive heatsink only helps to sustain 1-2 more volts; more power requires active cooling.

### Speakers selection

When choosing speakers, focus on realistic power ratings rather than the often-inflated numbers printed on labels.

A good reference point is 10 watts at 1% THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) — this provides clean, pleasant audio without noticeable distortion. Many manufacturers, however, market their speakers based on higher distortion levels or theoretical peaks:
	•	Nominal Power (e.g., 20W) — This is often measured at around 10% THD, which produces harsh, phone-like distortion.
	•	Rated or “Maximum” Power (e.g., 40W) — The level a speaker can handle continuously, but without limiting distortion; sound quality is not measured. It is simply a scenario where speaker is used as a room heater.
	•	Peak Power (e.g., 80–100W) — The absolute maximum a speaker can withstand for a very short burst (milliseconds), not suitable for sustained playback.

In short, when a speaker claims “100W,” it typically translates to about 10W of clean, listenable power in real use. Always prioritize low-distortion ratings over inflated wattage numbers for the best listening experience.

### OLED screen

Starting May 2025, all boards will have an OLED screen solder-less connector. Originally, I added the OLED header on the back side of the PCB that would require careful and skillful soldering (It is quite nice when using squeezelite since you can get quite a lot with existing plugins and settings). Later on, I managed to find the right model of the screen and corresponding connector for a reasonable price, and decided to equip every board with the connector as standard. 

At this moment, one can simply throw in a compatible OLED screen and use a small strap of double-sided adhesive to fix it mechanically. The final result is a nice and finished look

#### OLED models

Most of the 64x128 pixel OLED screen models that are very common among hobbyists will use a compatible 30-pin ribbon connector with 0.5mm pin spacing, and they are really easy to find.

#### Software side

Although you're free to use it your way, using the pinout above, I'd expect the most common case to be squeezelite, thus here are the steps you'd need to do

| # | Description | Image |
